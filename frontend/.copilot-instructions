You are helping build the frontend for a Job Board app using React + Vite, TailwindCSS, and shadcn/ui.

Rules:
- Use functional components and hooks.
- Use TailwindCSS for layout and styling.
- Use shadcn/ui components for forms, modals, and buttons.
- Keep components modular (e.g., Layout, Header, JobCard, etc.).
- Write clear, well-indented JSX with minimal logic inside templates.
- Prefer clean, readable code over clever one-liners.
- Add small comments explaining non-trivial logic.
